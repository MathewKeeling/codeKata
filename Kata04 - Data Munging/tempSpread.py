#  Part One: Weather Data

#  In weather.dat youâ€™ll find daily weather data for Morristown, NJ for June 2002.

#  Write a program to output the day number with the smallest temperature spread 
#    Column one: Day
#    Column two: maximum temperature
#    Column three: minimum temperature

#  Days:              03 04
#  Temperature (max): 07 08 09 10
#  Temperature (min): 13 14 15 16
#  Lines: 3 - 32
