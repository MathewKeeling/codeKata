## Notes after completing 1/3

I switched out the 330k word dictionary for a 20k word one. Reduced time to complete from 3+ minutes to a few seconds.

I am noticing that thought this one appears to work... words that fail the test still get their own element in the dictionary.

Further, the dictionary is unsorted. (I wonder why? lol)
