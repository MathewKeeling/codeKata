## Notes after completing 1/3

I switched out the 330k word dictionary for a 20k word one. Reduced time to complete from 3+ minutes to a few seconds.

I am noticing that thought this one appears to work... words that fail the test still get their own element in the dictionary.

Further, the dictionary is unsorted. (I wonder why? lol)

## Notes after editing 1/3

Fixed the ordering by sorting the words after getting them.

Fixed the gaps in the prints by doing an if then pass/print

Eliminated the smaller words by implementing a new method to get words of exact length that is discrete from the method to get words of max length.
