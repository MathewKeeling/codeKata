## Notes after completing 1/3

I switched out the 330k word dictionary for a 20k word one. Reduced time to complete from 3+ minutes to a few seconds.

I am noticing that thought this one appears to work... words that fail the test still get their own element in the dictionary.

Further, the dictionary is unsorted. (I wonder why? lol)

## Notes after editing 1/3

Fixed the ordering by sorting the words after getting them.

Fixed the gaps in the prints by doing an if then pass/print

Eliminated the smaller words by implementing a new method to get words of exact length that is discrete from the method to get words of max length.

## Notes for 2022/02/11 before sign off

Can't work out this weird bug.

The program seems to iterate some number of words in 10 seconds from a - z.

Then at 10 seconds, the alphabet appears to restart and it iterates through another 60 seconds worth of execution of words in alphabetical order from A-Z again.

Odd.
