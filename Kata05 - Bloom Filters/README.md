#### Note 2022/02/11
* I realized that I did this problem incorrectly.
* I've only just come to grasp what a Hash Table is much less a bloom filter.
* I need to redo this and use a bitmap / bit vector that is ~330k long, and flip bits 0 and 1 to represent the words. Not store the words themselves in the hashmap.
* I'll get back to this.

#### Note 2022/02/12
* I'm revisiting this to give it another go using a bitmap
