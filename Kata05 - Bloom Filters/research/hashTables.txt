    A bit over my head on first viewing. Hadn't consulted any reference material first.
        Maybe try watching it later again after reviewing the relevant literature.

Notes
[2]
    Lists
        ...are objects that contain objects capable of arbitrary nesting
        They are accessed by index value left to right. 
            list[i][j]


    Dictionaries
        ...are like listed, but you don't reference values by index number
            You access them by defining the key. 
                >>> dictionary[key] --> returns the value associated with the 
                supplied key.
        Unlike lists, dictionaries are not stored in the order they are initially
            created. They appear in the order that they are stored in memory.
        This is intentional. It is much faster to retrieve a value using a dictionary
            key value pair than trees or iteratively searching through a list.
