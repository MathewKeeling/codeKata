O(1) vs O(n)

Constant Time vs Linear Time

Big O of N, or Linear time O(n)
n refers to the numbe rof items in your list, and your algorithm function scales
    with the number of elements in your array

O(1), Dictionary, or Hashmap, Constant Time (big O of 1, or Constant Time)
    Dictionary: large mapping of key:value pairs

Dictionaries / Hashmaps
    A bunch of keys need to be mapped to certain buckets.
    The mapping occurs through something called a hash functino.
    The keys for our specific characters (strings) maps to a value of 1
    Constant time b/c doesn't matter how big the data structure is:
        The lookup time is always going to be constant, because no matter  
        what you supply, it's going to use its function to find a particular
        place in memory to look for the data being searched for.
