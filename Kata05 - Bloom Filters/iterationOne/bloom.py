#  Kata05 - Bloom Filters

#  Kata05 - Bloom Hash
#  So, this kata is fairly straightforward. Implement a Bloom filter based spell
#    checker. Youâ€™ll need some kind of bitmap, some hash functions, and a simple way 
#    of reading in the dictionary and then the words to check. For the hash function, 
#    remember that you can always use something that generates a fairly long hash 
#    (such as MD5) and then take your smaller hash values by extracting sequences 
#    of bits from the result. 

#  this is done incorrectly. But that's not all bad. It is going to serve as the example
#    case for how much space can be saved by using a bloom filter compared with
#    storing the whole dictionary in memory
#  That speaks not to speed but memory requiresments.
#  This will be the very worst case, because not only is the word itself stored...
#    but also the hash is stored.

#  after running a test, I am now convinced that I am not sure what this 
#    program is even doing. The array containing the hashes and words is smaller
#    in size than even the bitvector of 12x dictionary length of iterationTwo
#    something is wrong... need to do more digging
#
#  if this were a pure "does x = x?" while x is stored in memory, the false positive
#    rate would not be as high as it is:
#
#  Result of test:
#    Words:  20000
#    Bit_Vector Length: N/A
#    Size of Dictionary Array:  0.000232 Megabytes
#    False Positives:  18657
#    False Positives Percent:  93.285
#
#  ...It's tough to tell for my ignorance.
#    but I am guessing that in its current implementation it is actually working
#      as a bloom filter
