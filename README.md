# codeKata

## Working through http://codekata.com/blog/archives/

### Introduction
I'm just working through some kata to learn some stuff.

### Bibliography

I'm reading the following books and have been using them as resource materials. They're pretty great.

* Introduction to Algorithms 2E - Thomas H. Cormen, Et. Al.
* Learning Python 4E - Lutz, O'Reilly, Et. Al.
* Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python - Franklin Beedle, Et. Al.
* Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python: revised and Expanded Edition - Guttag

### MIT OCW

In addition to those resources, I have been taking advantage of MIT's OCW.
Particularly:
* 6.0001
* 6.0002
* 6.0004
* 6.0005
* 6.042[J]

You can find some of my notes relating to that stuff in my other GitHub repos...

I won't publish notes until I've completed a course, so expect dead time.

### Future Plans

When I finish up with these Codekata's I'm going to revisit all of them... then I am going to poke around the ones posted on codedojo.com
